# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game on Aptos
This is a detailed run-down of the features added to rock-paper-scissors game built during the third aptos campaign.

## Additional features:

### Player vs Player:
I integrated the functionality that enables a player to play the game with another player (player v player) and not just with the computer alone. So the player can choose to play with the computer if there's no third party (or if he's feeling lonley😅). 

### Storing and deleting scores:
I edited the smart contract such that the scores of both the players and the computer are tracked and incremented accordingly, no matter the number of rounds played. I also added the ability to reset the scores in the event that the player(s) wish to start the game over again.

## Summary:

These new features significantly enhance the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The **Player vs Player mode** introduces a social aspect, making the game more engaging and fun by allowing players to compete against each other. This not only adds variety but also encourages friendly competition.

The **score tracking and reset functionality** ensures that players can keep track of their progress over multiple rounds while the ability to reset scores provides flexibility, allowing players to start fresh whenever they want.

Overall, these updates make the game more interactive, versatile, and enjoyable for users🙏🏾.
